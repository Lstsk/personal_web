## Setting Up A New Mac for Development: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here's a quick note documenting how I recently set up my Mac for development use.&#x20;

### 1. Install Warp Terminal

Warp is a modern, fast terminal that can replace the default macOS Terminal. You can download and install it from [warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev/).

### 2. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is an essential package manager for macOS that simplifies software installation.

#### Installation Steps:

1. Open **Terminal** and run:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Add Homebrew to your PATH:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   brew doctor
   ```

### 3. Install Essential Packages

Using Homebrew, install commonly used tools like Git:

```bash
brew install git
```

### 4. Set Up Zsh and Oh My Zsh

Zsh is the default shell on macOS, and Oh My Zsh provides powerful customization options.

#### Steps to Install Oh My Zsh:

1. Run the installation command:

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Configure recommended plugins in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
   ```

3. Install the plugins:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
   git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
   ```

4. Activate the plugins:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

#### Install Powerlevel10k Theme

1. Clone the Powerlevel10k repository:

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
   ```

2. Set the theme in `~/.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
   ```

3. Reload your shell:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### 5. Set Up Git

Git is essential for version control. Here’s how to configure it:

1. Set up your Git credentials:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   ```

2. Generate an SSH key for GitHub:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```

3. Add the key to GitHub:

   ```bash
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

Paste the copied key into your GitHub account under **SSH and GPG keys**.

### 6. Install a Code Editor

Consider using [Cursor](https://cursor.com), an AI-powered code editor built on Visual Studio Code’s foundation. It offers robust AI features for development and is an excellent alternative to VS Code.

### 7. Set Up Development Languages

#### Python

1. Install `pyenv` to manage Python versions:
   ```bash
   brew install pyenv
   pyenv install 3.x.x  # Replace with your desired version
   pyenv global 3.x.x
   ```

#### Node.js

1. Use `nvm` to manage Node.js versions:
   ```bash
   brew install nvm
   mkdir ~/.nvm
   echo 'export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo '[ -s "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   nvm install --lts
   ```
